# Moonlit Psychiatry Style Guide

## Overview
This style guide ensures consistent, professional, and compassionate communication across all Moonlit Psychiatry touchpoints. It covers brand voice, clinical documentation, patient communication, and visual identity.

## Brand Voice & Tone

### Core Principles
- **Professional yet Approachable**: We are experts who speak like humans, not robots
- **Compassionate**: Mental health care requires empathy and understanding
- **Evidence-Based**: Our recommendations are grounded in current psychiatric research
- **Clear and Direct**: We avoid jargon when possible; when technical terms are necessary, we explain them
- **Respectful of Autonomy**: We partner with patients rather than dictate to them

### Voice Characteristics
- Warm but not overly casual
- Confident but not arrogant
- Informative but not overwhelming
- Supportive but not patronizing

### What We Say
✓ "Let's work together to find the right approach for you"
✓ "Many people experience this"
✓ "This is a common side effect that often improves"
✓ "I'd like to understand more about what you're experiencing"

### What We Avoid
✗ "You just need to..." (dismissive)
✗ "Everyone feels this way" (minimizing)
✗ Overuse of medical jargon without explanation
✗ Stigmatizing language around mental health conditions

## Clinical Documentation

### General Principles
- **Clarity**: Notes should be understandable to other providers
- **Conciseness**: Include relevant information without unnecessary verbosity
- **Person-First Language**: "Patient with depression" not "depressive patient"
- **Objectivity**: Distinguish between objective observations and subjective reports
- **Professionalism**: Documentation may be read by patients and in legal contexts

### Epic EMR Standards
- Use standard templates for consistency
- Complete all required fields
- Document treatment rationale clearly for complex medication decisions
- Update problem lists and medication lists in real-time
- Sign notes within 24 hours of encounter

### CredibleBH Standards
- Ensure all required fields for billing compliance are completed
- Document medical necessity clearly
- Include specific treatment goals and interventions
- Track progress toward established goals

### Psychiatric Note Structure
1. **Chief Complaint**: Brief, in patient's own words when possible
2. **History of Present Illness**: Chronological, focused narrative
3. **Mental Status Exam**: Systematic and complete
4. **Assessment**: Clear diagnostic reasoning
5. **Plan**: Specific, actionable interventions with rationale

### Language Guidelines for Documentation
- Use "patient reports" or "patient states" for subjective information
- Use "observed," "appeared," or "demonstrated" for objective findings

- Document capacity and decision-making when relevant
- Be specific about safety assessments and risk

## Patient Communication

### Written Communication (Portal Messages, Letters)

### Phone Communication Guidelines
- Identify yourself and your role clearly
- Confirm patient identity using two identifiers

### Difficult Conversations

- Be direct about safety concerns
- Offer alternatives when saying no to a request
